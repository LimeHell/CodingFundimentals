follow me and qa chris
we're a genie and a bottle, but we wont grant you a wish
two guys in a call he's properly not here
we're the headlights and you're the deer

confessions of malpractice
refining the code
we're just branches in the tree
we're connecting the nodes

your voice shaken when the truth gets near
facts in that chat, josh don't wanna hear
